# Shakespearean Sonnet Generation

This is the Github repo for Yoshi's Island's CS155 Miniproject 3 code.

By using a Hidden Markov Model or a Recurrent Neural Network, we generate a 10-syllable, 14-line sonnet training with Shakespearean and/or Spenser's works.

The Jupyter Notebook contains all of the relevant code, including the pre-processing, training, and visualiztion.
